The Coffee Shop App is a responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to create an engaging and user-friendly online experience for coffee shop customers. Here are the key features and functionalities implemented in the project:

Dynamic Menu Display:
The app showcases a detailed menu featuring various coffee beverages. Each product is displayed with high-quality images, pricing (including discounted prices), and interactive icons such as "Add to Cart," "Favorite," and "Zoom." Users can click these icons to interact with the products, for example, viewing a larger image of the coffee.

Shopping Cart Functionality:
Users can add products to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" buttons. The cart dynamically updates to show the products, their quantities, and the total price. Additional features include the ability to decrease the quantity of an item or remove it entirely from the cart, with the total price recalculating automatically.

Interactive Popups:
The application features interactive popup screens, such as a checkout popup. When users click the "Checkout Now" button, a popup appears prompting them to enter their card details. After submitting the payment information, the form data is cleared, and a confirmation message is displayed.

Contact Section:
There is a dedicated contact section where users can enter their personal details (name, email, and phone number) to get in touch with the coffee shop. Upon submission, the app can either display the coffee shop's contact details or redirect the user to their email client using a mailto link.

Responsive Design:
The app is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops and mobile devices. Responsive CSS styles ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience.

Additional Interactive Elements: 
Other interactive features include a "Read More" toggle in the home section for additional content and a rating system where users can interact with elements like hearts or stars (if implemented), enhancing user engagement.

Overall, the Coffee Shop App provides a complete solution that combines modern web design, interactive functionality, and a seamless user experience. It is a showcase project that leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a visually appealing and functionally robust application for a coffee shop.
